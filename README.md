<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot]](https://curiousraccoon08.github.io/Restaurant-s-Responsive-Website/)

There are many great food ordering website designs, however , I didn't findone that really satisfies me so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a food ordering website so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need --  I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on main elements of the website and the one shoud not be confused on what to explore on the website. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You should implement this template for your website and that's all.

Of course, no one's template will serve all websites type since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
